We are here to talk about the tcs3200 sensor and learn about how it works<br /> 
1.How to Install and Run the Project:<br />
1.1.in our method to use tcs3200 to detect colors you don't need any special library for<br />
1.2.At this stage, you have to build your circuit from it using the circuit that I have placed for you (Do this carefully)<br />
1.3.just run Arduino ...<br />
1.4.run the code and change the pin if you're pin is different to connect to (define) ...<br />
1.5.when you see the output of sensor and code you have to think about how ? <br />
2. Ask this question (how does it work)?
2.1.search in google and i have spechial opinion for you read datashit to undrastand beeter this sensor and how it work. <br />(my spechial opinion <br />https://lastminuteengineers.com/tcs230-tcs3200-color-sensor-arduino-tutorial/)<br />
Then if you understand 80% of how it works you can use your creativity and you do not need to copy the code<br />
3.If you have any questions, you can ask them through these communication channels and get the answer from me<br />

Tips for detect color : <br />
the easiest way : use if and take some range number for any color<br />
but this is not best way ...
