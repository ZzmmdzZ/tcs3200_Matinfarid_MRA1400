# tcs3200 how does it works?
we want to talk about tcs3200 how to detect colors and how to make difference between any color
## components
* same wire
 * Arduino board
  * tcs3200 module
## lets see what i have to do ?

## How to start it ?
* copy code from [here](https://github.com/ZzmmdzZ/tcs3200_Matinfarid_MRA1400/blob/main/code) 
* paste to Arduino IDE
* plug in your arduino board
* press Ctrl + u
  * then press shift + Crl + m
## I only see a few numbers what I have to do for detect colors ?
#### **_my opinion_** :
just read this [content](https://lastminuteengineers.com/tcs230-tcs3200-color-sensor-arduino-tutorial/) to know this sensor how to make some number and then go for write if or any algorithm for detect colors
